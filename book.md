# Alphabet
Vietnamese has a 29-letter alphabet ([Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet))

At first glance it looks similar to English with just a few accents but it can be deceiving. The letters, particularly the vowels, don't usually sound like their English comunterparts so you need to learn them carefully.

There are 3 types of A, 3 types of O, 2 types of U, 2 types of E and 1 type of I.

### The As

I like to think of the three As as sitting on a continuum from extremely open to extremely closed (A - Ă - Â)

__A__ is open like in **aunt** or **father** (kind of a longer version of the first one)

__Ă__　with a crescent on top is said like the U in UNDER. A bit shorter than A.

__Â__ (with a conical Vietnamese hat) rhymes with the vowel in h**i**t or m**i**ss (watch out for this one - very different than an English A) 

### The Os

- O
- Ô
- Ơ

### The Us

- U
- Ư

### The Es

- E
- Ê

### The I

- I is always a long /ee/ sound

### The Y

While we are talking about vowels, the "y" in Vietnamese is also an /ee/ sound but when it is inside a word, it is said fast and merges with the following consonant.

## Special Vietnamese Letters

## Tones

There are 6 tones that affect how you say each word. Words only have one tone each and always stay the same (i.e. the tone is attached to that word and doesn't change)

## Using a Vietnamese Keyboard

- Choose either Vietnamese or Telex keyboard
- Each tone has a letter attached to it. This is why it's sometimes hard to mix English and Vietnamese using the same keyboard. If you type the letter twice, it should let you actually type a W, etc.
- If you type the wrong tone key, you don't have to erase the word, just type the one you wanted and it will fix for you.
- Tones (using a an an example vowel)
    + huyền 'hanging' à **af**
    + sắc   'sharp' á **as**
    + hỏi   'asking' ả **ar**
    + ngã   'tumbling' ã **ax**
    + nặng   'heavy' ạ **aj**
