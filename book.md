## Tones

There are 6 tones that affect how you say each word. Words only have one tone each and always stay the same (i.e. the tone is attached to that word and doesn't change)



## Using a Vietnamese Keyboard

- Choose either Vietnamese or telex
tones - r, j, s, f, x
- For the hooks do a w after the letter
- For the hats and the cross through the d, do a double letter
