#Alphabet
Vietnamese has a 29-letter alphabet

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_alphabet

The Latin alphabet[change | change source]
The main letters from the Latin alphabet:

a,b,c,d,e,g,h,i,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,x,y,qu

The first set of changed letters[change | change source]
ô, ơ, â, ă, ê, ư, đ


There are 6 tones that you say each word. Words only have one tone each and always stay the same (i.e. the tone is attached to that word and doesn't change)



##Using a Vietnamese Keyboard

Choose either Vietnamese or telex
tones - r, j, s, f, x
For the hooks do a w after the letter
For the hats and the cross through the d, do a double letter
