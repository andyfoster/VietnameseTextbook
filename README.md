# VietnameseTextbook

This is a project to create a great Vietnamese textbook for students of the language to learn in an intuitive way. 
Vietnamese is a fairly simple language in terms of grammar but has many features that can trip learners up, not the least of which 
is all the tones and the letters that looks like ones in English but are pronounced completely differently.
THis means that similar looking words have vastly different meanings and pronunciations. I'd like to teach words like this together, 
o that learners can see the difference and remember the words more easily. It will include more language-learning tehniques and ideas as 
well as motivation. I want to include real signs and usage of Vietnamese from Vietnam. 

I want to have useful sections in here like what you need to have conversations at the market and getting things fixed on your motorbike, 
ordering food over the food.
We want you to speak from day one so there will be lots of topics and phrases you can use to get people to repeat themselves, talk more slowly etc

So much of the Vietnamese language is influenced by their legends and history so we will talk about that as we go along.

I've been frustracted by the lack of quality material for learning Vietnamese and especially the variety. Other lnaguages have so much 
material for learning that each learner can choose their own method. Vietnamese still doesn't have much in the way of cohesive material
so I want to create it here.

Feel free to suggest any additions or alterations that you think will improve this.
