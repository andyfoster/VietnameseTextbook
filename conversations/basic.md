## Questions every Vietnamese person will ask you (and how to answer)

Every conversation you have in Vietnamese will start like this:

### What nationality are you?
*Người nước nào?*

*Tôi là người Mỹ.* (Me-e) 
I am an American

### Do you have a wife? or husband? or girlfirend
*Có vợ chưa?*
(variations: do you have a family, how many people in your family, etc)


### How old are you? 
*Bao nhiều tuổi?*

*Hai muoi hai tuoi* - I am 22


### How long have you been in Hanoi?
*Bạn ở Hanoi bao lau rồi?*


### Are you working or travelling?
*Lam viec* work
*Du lich* travel


If you can answer a single one of these questions, they will lie and tell you that you speak Vietnamese very well: *Em noi tieng Viet gioi*

It's worth preparing a humorous retort to this. 
My friend says that he is as stupid as a cow which people find quite funny.
__Khong phai. Em ngu nhu bo__
