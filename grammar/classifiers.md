## Classifiers

Classifiers come before a noun and mark what category the noun is in.
We only have a few classfiers in English. We have things like 'a pair' in English. 
Imagine if every category had its own special word. There aren't too many.
These are especially used when you want to say how many of something there are,

If in doubt, you can just use the general 'object' classifier, 'cái'. (cái này là cái gì? What is this thing?) and they will just use the correct one in the answer.

một cái bàn - one table (object)

một con gà - one chicken (animal)
